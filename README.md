# AI-Powered Client Feedback Summarization System

This project is an end-to-end pipeline that ingests multi-channel client feedback
(emails, documents, chat messages), stores it in AWS S3 and Snowflake, processes it 
using LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, or Mistral), and provides summarized feedback per client via an API and dashboard for business teams.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Ingest feedback from Gmail, Slack, SharePoint, and PDF/DOCX files.
- Upload raw data to AWS S3 (Raw Zone).
- Transform and load cleaned data into Snowflake via AWS Glue.
- Summarize per-client feedback using an OpenAI LLM via FastAPI.
- Display summarized feedback through a Streamlit dashboard.
